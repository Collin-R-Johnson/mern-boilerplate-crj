# mern-boilerplate-crj
an evolving "boilerplate" with relevent milestones tagged for particular use cases. 
starting from a monolithic MERN stack application that runs locally I will make changes to serve as jumping off points for a wider variety of projects. The goal is to dockerize these minimal applications, breaking them down into microservices
and bundling them together. tweaking support libraries and configurations in ways which may prove useful. Personally I'm aiming to enhance my understanding of the MERN stack structure and the tools that it relies on to get work done.
